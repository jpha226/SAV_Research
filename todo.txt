To do list:
Verify all metrics:
	- For SCRAM: unoccupied travel, wait time, trips served, cars required, wait time broken down by 5 minute intervals, hot & cold starts
Let SCRAM reassign at each time step
Change random seed and how a run starts

Ask Donna about why runs are consecutive days
Ask Dr. Stone about random generator (If I need multiple rand_gens)

Vary the number of cars available
Use SCRAM in large domain
